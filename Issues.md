# Issues

## Some videos require sign in which disrupts the user experience
Original proposal:
```
    <!-- <li><a href="javascript:void(0);" onclick='window.parent.urlChange.playlist(event, $(this).data("playlist-id"));' data-playlist-id='PLzg85AHZsA6aRZ5oiQf02iRIyOa5yQkTy'>[~Dev Test] Req Sign In</a></li> -->
```
Need solution: The proposal fails because "Age-restricted videos canâ€™t be watched on most 3rd party websites"
New proposal: See if there's a way to add your website as a third party.
